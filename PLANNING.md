# HDIP Project Planning

## Project Vision
Create a unified platform that accelerates healthcare innovation by enabling efficient discovery, access, and utilization of health data assets while ensuring compliance with governance requirements.

## Goals
1. Simplify health data discovery through a comprehensive catalog
2. Standardize metadata across diverse health datasets
3. Streamline data access request processes
4. Ensure governance compliance through automated tracking
5. Provide analytics on data usage and quality
6. Educate users on best practices through knowledge resources

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router
- **UI**: React components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context and Hooks
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js

### Backend
- **API**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or similar relational database)
- **Storage**: Object storage for larger files/datasets

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel or similar platform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Application monitoring and error tracking

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Platform (Current)
- Data catalog with basic search and filtering
- Dataset detail pages with metadata display
- FAIR score assessment
- Basic user authentication and profiles

### Phase 2: Governance & Analytics
- Consent tracking implementation
- Audit logging system
- Usage statistics dashboard
- FAIR score trends analysis
- Data value calculator

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- AI-powered dataset recommendations
- Advanced search with natural language processing
- Integration with external data repositories
- Automated metadata extraction
- Collaborative workspace for data users

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- Implement accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)
- Optimize performance for large dataset catalogs
- Design for internationalization support
- Implement comprehensive error handling

## Risk Assessment
- Data privacy compliance challenges
- Scalability with large number of datasets
- User adoption and engagement
- Integration with existing systems
- Metadata standardization across diverse sources

## Success Metrics
- Number of datasets cataloged
- User engagement statistics
- Request processing time reduction
- Improvement in average FAIR scores
- User satisfaction ratings
